Serial No.,Review
1,"I have severe anxiety panic disorder that started when I was a child. I have been taking Xanax for over 30 years now. Every day I take 4 pills, but on really bad days I take 6 pills. My doctor has retired, and now I have a new doctor who is cutting me off. Instead of taking 4 pills every day, they only gave me enough for half a pill per day. I'm never able to sleep due to extreme insomnia, anxiety, and panic attacks that plague me every day. I was shocked at how much they cut me off and so quickly. Right now, I am in critical condition. They say I exceeded my monthly limit. When I was given Xanax, I was able to function, sleep normally, eat, and live a normal life. I have been taking Xanax for over 30 years. It is truly inhumane. My body relies on taking medicine every day, and suddenly being cut off will be really hard on my body. Some people really do need Xanax."
2,"I've had GAD since a child, losing a parent early. My first panic attack was at 12, not knowing why I was suddenly unable to breathe. After repeated traumatic experiences, I developed a social aversion that rapidly turned into severe agoraphobia. Without this life-saving drug, I would have never been able to have a recording career, find my spouse, and live a normal life. The days I am using this medication are 100x more productive and filled with joy. I'm sick of seeing only negative propaganda about Xanax. If you are a responsible adult who uses it properly, it is not harmful. If you use a heart medication each day, and it keeps you healthy, are you 'addicted' to that? It's the same with anxiety. Mental health is just as serious as the physical. Just because some are abusing it doesn't mean judge those who use it correctly. I appreciate everything this med has done for me!"
3,"I have been on Xanax for about 20 years, 1mg for sleep. I am not addicted to it but dependent like a person with high blood pressure is dependent on meds, or diabetic dependent on insulin, or humans dependent on oxygen. I have had no side reactions and am 78 years old. It has saved my life. Try not sleeping for a week and see what happens. You will be inside your worst nightmare. Why the uproar over physical dependence, I do not know. It must come from the Gov."
4,"I'm new to taking Xanax and to this site. I'm 31 years old, got married in June to a man who doesn't believe in anxiety, so it makes me feel worse. I have been so scared to take it due to the fact I have taken stuff as a teen that made me feel really out of it and depressed. I have been to every doctor and emergency room late at night, sick to my stomach, my chest feeling heavy and my head heavy and fuzzy, can't focus, dizzy, hot, tingling feeling numbness in my face, my lips, my arms, and everyone says it's anxiety or a panic attack. I feel so alone in this, and I'm scared that there is something really wrong with me and the doctors are just not finding it. I feel hopeless. I hope the Xanax will help do something. I can't function in society, and I'm tired of faking that I'm okay when I'm dying inside. Does anyone else feel like this, or am I just crazy?"
5,"I started with Xanax for anxiety 30 years ago and have gradually increased. I used to take perhaps 0.25mg occasionally when I started, and now 30 years later, at age 71, I am up to three 0.5mg a day. I successfully fight to not take it more often and I almost always win the fight. When I don't, I take an extra 0.25mg or 0.5mg. Meanwhile, without it, I would not have had a successful college teaching career, traveled to Europe 28 times, produced a cable TV show, written 3 books, had hundreds of friends who love and respect me, and even worked out at the gym where I swim, walk, and work out with weights regularly. My current psychiatrist tells me frequently (I ask him every few months because I read terrible things) that I should not be concerned, that I am using it intelligently, and it helps me live a great and fantastic life filled with success, satisfaction, love, and affection of so many people. My anxiety could be debilitating, but here I am living a great life."
6,"I've been on 1mg Xanax for about 26 years. Lord knows I have to have them. I know they say it's not good for you to be on them that long, but I have anxiety so much. It's the only thing that helps me. I started out with the 0.5mg, but they were not strong enough. I am really sorry for anyone that struggles like I do. My anxiety has worsened since Covid-19 came out. I have taken 2 tests which were negative, but it's so scary. I had to quit my job because some people don't wear masks and I won't have a test every time someone coughs. I get very nervous, but now I have begun to have social anxiety. I even have to go see a counselor. If you don't have to take them, then don't, but I have no other choice. I don't abuse them at all, I take them as prescribed. I pray for anyone that is going through this."
7,"Do not abuse Xanax, but as for the feeling, just imagine you just stepped into a toasty Jacuzzi and all the stress and unwanted feelings disappear. You take a breath, and you’re at peace. A little smile shows up on your face because you finally feel okay. Yeah, no need to explain why it’s addicting, literally has no bad side effects. Do not drink alcohol on it, it will make you forget! XANAX BEST DRUG IN THE WORLD FOR ANXIETY"
8,"Do not be afraid to try this medicine! The stigma of this drug caused me to avoid it for about 15 years. If I was prescribed it, I flushed it down the toilet. I FINALLY took one when I was so desperate I didn’t have any other choice. I take 0.5 most days. People take all kinds of medication for all kinds of other diseases. Anxiety and depression are diseases just the same as anything else. It’s a shame that we are made to feel like we’re doing something wrong for using Xanax. It has helped me control my anxiety and depression for about 8 years now. Without it, I honestly don’t know what would have happened to me by now. It stops the terrible cycle of impending doom. It has kept me from going into major anxiety and depression so many times I can’t count. Mental problems are the hardest thing I’ve EVER dealt with in my life. I’m almost 45 and have been fighting this since I was 18. Whoever you are, I hope wholeheartedly that you find help and hold on."
9,"I have had anxiety for many years. About 30. Not until 37 years old did it crush me. I started with Zoloft and buspirone. Then came the Xanax. The first day I took one, I felt like I have missed my life all these years. I looked at my wife and said the following, “Have I been an A-hole for the last 13 years?” She said yes. “You must really love me.” She said yes again. For the first time in my life, I realized how much anxiety took over my life. I can literally feel the difference in me being that angry anxiety-filled person. Now, I take 0.5 every 2 days. I actually enjoy life. Before, it was just there, like a clouded mind just floating there, not feeling or computing. When I take a Xanax, I feel alive, happy. I look at my kids and I can actually enjoy them and literally feel the abundance of love I have for them. And that makes life so much better to live."
10,"I have always had problems with social anxiety and depression since I was a teenager. Every antidepressant I took made me feel worse. I started taking 0.25 mg of Xanax 'if needed' in my late 30s when I was diagnosed with essential tremors of the head. It made a dramatic difference in my life! It helped immensely with my head tremors, social anxiety, and even my depression! I never abused it, and it never became habit-forming. I was on it for about 15 years off and on. Since then, my physician has retired, and I am now not able to find a doctor who will prescribe it. I don’t understand why THIS drug is being so controlled, when there is a whole country of alcoholics and booze still remains for sale openly in every grocery store or liquor store on every block! Alcohol caused thousands of deaths every day from tragic car crashes and alcoholic liver failure. Such a double standard. Xanax has helped so many responsible people who take it correctly!"
11,"Listen, I ONLY take it if I feel like my breathing exercises won't help and a panic attack is coming. I avoid taking it as soon as I get rapid heartbeats, etc. This is my security blanket, I carry it everywhere with me. It works like magic, and I always pray for the people who created this drug :) 3 years, no addiction. Use as needed! And remember, those panic attacks will come and go, they won't hurt us. Welcome them with a smile, that scares them."
12,"Well, I do not know where to start. For 20 years, crippling anxiety daily started from nowhere. All this time life was so hard, but I live for the sake of life and family. It was so bad that only those who live with it can understand. I tried SSRI, Tricyclic, Tetracyclic, Klonopin, Zyprexa, and much more. I live only because of the mercy of God! One day I asked Dr. to try Xanax. Dr. was not very pleased with this request but gave me 0.25 mg. I took my first dosage and was expecting unknown. The first thing that I noticed was that I became normal, like I used to be 20 years back. I noticed life, family, work, joy, etc. People are writing that it will be hard to drop this med, I see why! I was able to drop all listed med with no problem as they were not helping me, but this one I see why that is a challenge. I do not abuse it, taking only as needed, but if you are suffering, try it! Life is too short to plan ahead, in today's world, you never know which day will be your last, but if God has you to live, you will live."
13,"I was first diagnosed with panic disorder and agoraphobia 40 years ago. After seeing many doctors, I finally found one that understood the brain's chemistry. My mother had it and never left the house due to severe agoraphobia, and both of my children developed panic disorder. I have been on Xanax 0.5 four times a day for 37 years and was told because of my brain chemistry that I will need to take it forever. No one would ever guess I take Xanax as it does not slow me down but only makes me able to function daily and travel for work. For those of us with panic disorder, it is a lifesaver."
14,"I have been taking Xanax for 10 years. Through an alcohol addiction, I drink while on Xanax, not a good idea. If used as prescribed, it takes away my panic attacks. I couldn't even leave the house without it. It also helped me stop drinking, 3 years sober now, still on Xanax 1 mg 3 times daily. Some days now, I don't even take it. With proper self-control, it saved my life. Hands down. I had a lot of stress since quitting drinking between family members dying. This last year has been hard, to say the least. 2019 was probably the worst year of my life, and I stayed sober through it. No more alcohol."
15,"Xanax has literally saved my life. After going to the hospital for a panic attack and seizure due to an overwhelming feeling of fear and worry, my psychiatrist prescribed 2mg once daily. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. Listen, many people say it is an addictive drug... which it can be if taken incorrectly... however, if you have to take medicine for a heart condition, what is really the difference? The only people that don’t understand are the ones who have never suffered through a panic attack or had a moment of extreme anxiety. It can be very debilitating. I am grateful for this medication."
16,"I have used Xanax for 20 years. Always taken it as needed, and it works wonderfully, no side effects at all, no getting used to it as evidenced by not using it for days and no withdrawal. I tried everything else suffering severe side effects like Seroquel. I only need 1mg twice a day, maybe on real panic day three times."
17,"3 years on and off as needed. Not sure why this is a popular recreational drug? It really just makes me feel normal again when I start getting high blood pressure spikes from anxiety and panic attack symptoms. It definitely works, no side effects that I have been aware of."
18,"This drug has changed my life. I have always had an anxiety problem since I was a child. Didn't have a good childhood, got picked on because I was fat, etc. My parents always fought and everything would just worry me. Some nights I couldn't sleep. I've been suffering from anxiety and panic attacks for so long. I feel like people are talking bad about me. I used to get paranoid and get really anxious in public and had social phobia. I can cope with everything now."
19,"Every medical expert talks more negatively about Xanax as compared to its benefits. My experience till date is on the contrary. I am 70-plus with one functional kidney and two stents in my heart. I have been on Xanax 0.5 to 1 mg per day for over 25 years. Without Xanax, my life would have been miserable. Till date, by the grace of God, I have no negative issues that can be attributed to Xanax except dependence, which I don't mind as I can afford it. But consider the pros and cons. I drive in a normal way, my balance is normal, and it has helped me get rid of sleepless nights. Researchers should also take into account the cost/benefit ratio of Xanax and avoid so much negativity. My cardiologist has no issue with my taking Xanax as he confirmed to me that it doesn't lead to dementia. Please advise why I should leave Xanax and put myself in a miserable condition."
20,Suffered major depression and anxiety when my father died when I was 18 years of age. I constantly considered killing myself. Antidepressants and therapy had little effect on my outlook on life. But then I was prescribed Xanax. I learned to calm down and to actually take a look at my life. Just don’t abuse the drug and it works wonders.
21,"Makes me very sleepy, which is hard to deal with, but worth it not being paralyzed from the flight or fight all day and night. Also want to say shame on the ones of you for talking about the horror stories of withdrawal, that it is so bad for you and benzos ruin your life. Your horror stories stopped me from taking the med when I got it, which made me suffer longer. Withdrawal DOES not happen to everyone. Did you ever think about the fact that some people can't take antidepressants or other options? Some of us have to rely on therapy and benzos. Don't go scaring the people who clearly need the medicine. Please, just take the med if prescribed and get a doctor you trust. I cried and refused treatment I needed because of what some people have written. Rated lower right now because I haven't found the right dose yet."
22,"I suffered from severe separation anxiety, depression, panic attacks, PTSD, depersonalization. After trial and error with several medications, my Dr. prescribed me 0.5 Xanax (alprazolam). I was not driving my car for months, prior, I had to take three showers a day just to try and feel something. I felt like I was losing my mind, like I was constantly afflicted by brain fog. I felt like a passenger in my own body. Now I can cope and actually get out of bed, clean, and cook for my family. I don't know how or why I came about all the symptoms, but if my Dr. wouldn't have recommended this and prescribed it, I would probably be dead. Alprazolam saved my life."
23,"This is crazy what they are currently putting me through to get off of this FANTASTIC drug. I was prescribed this drug at the age of 17 after my brother died. Everyone on my maternal side since my great grandmother had been on this drug. I have been on Xanax since I was 17. I now can live a normal life, go to school, get FANTASTIC grades, am a mother of 2. I love my daily life till my doctor passed away... now I cannot find a doctor to prescribe it. I do not abuse this drug and they have no reason to want to take me off of this drug. I have had great success from this drug. I wish I could find a psychologist that would continue to prescribe this medication when it really works successfully for myself. It is not fair that doctors are pressured to not prescribe this medication for those who need it. I am never going to leave my house and it's going to take a toll on my children as well. It's just unfair. If anyone knows a psychiatrist in Philadelphia suburbs, please let me know."
24,"Xanax is a miracle for me. I can't live without it. It is not addicting. I never experienced withdrawal symptoms either. I am usually tense, high strung, and anxious. Xanax makes me happy, easy-going, talkative, and calm. It helps me sleep, I can't sleep without it. I take Zoloft and Seroquel, but without Xanax, nothing seems to work or help me. I love Xanax, and I take it daily, or else I really just can't get through the day. I have anger, a short fuse, and bad temper, and Xanax calms my storms. Xanax is the only thing that works for me and makes me sane and able to face life head-on."
25,"Xanax really helps me with my panic attacks. If normally a panic attack would last me around 3-4 hours, if I take this, it will be gone in around 30 minutes and then feel extremely calm and peaceful. It really helps a lot, and I don't think I'll ever stop taking it, because I just can't deal with my panic attacks on my own."
