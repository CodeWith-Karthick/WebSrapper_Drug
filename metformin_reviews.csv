Serial No.,Review
1,"I have been taking metformin for 5 months now and I am losing a bit of my weight. However, one thing that concerns me is that I am having diarrhea all the time. The worst part is that if I am going out for a walk or groceries, in the middle of these situations, I really need to go to the toilet straight away, otherwise, I will have an accident. This is really disturbing for me because some parts of my daily life activities are affected. I need to stay home or make sure that I am near a restroom if I need to go somewhere. I don't know if other people with type 2 diabetes are experiencing the same issues. Thank you."
2,"Found out I was insulin resistant after a 2-hour glucose test. My doctor prescribed Glucophage, which I was very apprehensive of taking. I happen to suffer from severe anxiety and bouts of depression. After taking this drug, my life changed. No depression, no anxiety, and no brain fog. I didn't experience any negative side effects. This has literally changed my life. No psychiatrist has ever been able to cure my anxiety. Happy to say I am cured. Anxiety and depression free for the first time in 15 years."
3,"My doctor just put me on Metformin extended release 500mg twice a day, and I'm getting a lot of brain fog. I've been on it for 6 months, and I'm getting very forgetful. I wanted to know, does anybody else experience this? It's very hard to concentrate."
4,"If you take the medication with food you'll avoid an upset stomach, avoid processed sugar (metformin basically just makes you expel it) and you'll avoid the worst diarrhea of your life. I started taking metformin in January 2019 for infertility and PCOS symptoms. It helped regulate my period. Within 2 months of taking it (coupled with a dietary change of no processed sugars), I lost 40 lbs in 4 months and I was pregnant by April 2019. Started taking metformin again to help with PCOS symptoms for ovulation in October 2020 (between then and March total weight loss 50 lbs) pregnant positive March 2021. My doctor believes it's a combination of the metformin for ovulation and weight loss making it easier to get pregnant. Hope this helps you on your journey."
5,"Life changing! 500 mg 1x/day, and low-carb diet (7+/- servings a day and when I started, I was 375 lbs). Very compliant, 60 lb loss in 60 days, added daily hour of cardio (Zumba), continued and in 24 months lost 150 lbs. ALL side effects of metformin are indicators that you're eating too many carbs. A doctor that prescribes metformin that doesn't also prescribe a low-carb diet is being absurd. I've been amazed at how many people I've talked to over the years that have had that happen. Diarrhea, nausea, metallic taste, all mean you're eating the wrong things! They're not a reason to quit the meds. They're proof you need to eat low carb. 7 years later, still down 100, and increasing dose to continue losing."
6,"My story is similar to those who have posted. I gained A LOT of weight and had unwanted hair growth due to polycystic ovarian syndrome. I've been on metformin for almost 3 weeks and have lost 13 lbs. The day I started metformin, I also started a low-carb diet. Prior to metformin, I couldn't control my craving for salty, carb-filled food. For the past two and a half weeks, I have been able to finally control the cravings. My energy levels have increased by 50%. I also waxed the unwanted hair the day I started, and already I have noticed that less is growing back in. I wish I started metformin two years ago because I literally feel like PCOS has taken two years of my life away from me! I hope it works for others as well as it has worked for me."
7,"Guys, don’t give up. I took Metformin 4 and a half years ago for my PCOS as I was trying to conceive. I did one round of Clomid and fell pregnant but had an ectopic pregnancy and had my right side tube removed. Then a year later we went for an IVF round and that was unsuccessful. I gave myself some time to recover from the heartache. My doctor recommended me to take Metformin to regulate my period. I started with 3 tablets a day, 1500mg. I experienced nausea for the first 2-3 weeks. I did lose a few pounds but was never overweight (BMI 24). I started taking the tablets in January and my period started to regulate after two months. My husband and I had an appointment for a second round of IVF on June 15, and I decided to do a pregnancy test in June 2015 as I was feeling very tired. To my surprise, it came out positive. I took Metformin for 5 months to give me a miracle baby after one test tube baby. My baby was born on time and healthy. He is turning 4 years old next month."
8,"Feeling energized, my skin, hair, and nails look flawless. My mood has improved tremendously, I feel prettier and somehow sexier. I'm even turning some heads at the stop lights, lol. Not craving for sweets and not feeling hungry at night. Eating half of my usual portions because I feel plenty after a few bites. No headaches or dizziness, just a little stomach looseness. I'm always thirsty, which is good because I'm drinking 1.5 liters of water when I was used to 500 ml only. My belly looks definitely less bloated. I love you, metformin <3"
9,"So far, Metformin has been a wonder drug for me. I'm dropping weight, not hungry at all, and my energy levels are up. I'm taking one with each meal. I'm losing 5+ lbs a week, and it's all from my stomach fat. I've had one bout of diarrhea, but that was in the first 3 days of use, and when I took 2 in the AM versus 1 with each meal. I do think I need to drink more water with this prescription as it seems to slow bowel movements down. No other issues. I'm taking a blood pressure medication and B-12 supplements with it. And a multivitamin."
10,"Metformin definitely works. My husband and I had been trying for almost a year before seeking help from a doctor. I found out that I have PCOS. My OB-GYN immediately put me on Metformin 500mg for the first two weeks and then increased it to 1000mg in the third week. I started on 6/28 and by 7/28 (a date I will never forget), I got a positive pregnancy test. That means I got pregnant after 2 weeks of using Metformin along with eating healthy and working out for 40 minutes per day. Ladies, don't ever give up, keep your hope up, and remember the power of prayers. 'Just ask, and you will receive. Just knock, and the door will be opened.'"
11,"Been on metformin 5 days for insulin resistance, no side effects so far. Except I am extremely happy, is this a happy pill? My SSRI never came close to this when I was on it. Seriously good mood and no anxiety."
12,"I am 29 years old. I started metformin after having a large cyst rupture on my right ovary. I got a proper diagnosis of PCOS after that. I was on metformin for 10 months at 1000mg daily. My cycles became regulated. They still weren't the typical 28 days, but I got one every month at least. I tested positive with a pregnancy test after 10 months and am currently 10 weeks pregnant! We didn't take anything else. I only took the metformin. I hope this helps!"
13,"I'm 34 years old and my DH and I have been TTC on and off for 10 years. I was diagnosed with 'unexplained' infertility. I switched doctors, she diagnosed me with PCOS and prescribed me metformin. I took it for a month (my dose of metformin was one 500-milligram tablet daily for 2 weeks, then 2 a day) and took a pregnancy test. For the first time in my life, I received a positive!! At my first appointment, it was determined that I had an ectopic pregnancy. It was devastating. I had to wait 3 months after that to start trying again; however, I'm convinced the metformin worked! Good luck to you all!! I'll update when/if we get our miracle. Keep the faith, ladies! Lots of prayers to those struggling to conceive. May God bless you all."
14,"My husband was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes over 10 years ago. Started with metformin, but the numbers were jumping high. So the doctor added another one, but numbers were still out of range. Then another pill, and talk of insulin, the next option. A blood pressure pill was added to protect the kidneys. The past summer, my husband joined me on the keto lifestyle as well as intermittent fasting. He went off all meds (the doctor knew). His glucose readings were great. But the doctor told him that he wanted him to get back on metformin because the latest research showed that it can extend one's life and is good for the heart. My husband did not want to do this, but I pushed, and he started back on it. Well, almost immediately, his blood sugar spiked into the low 200s, then mid-200s. He went off it, and within 48 hours, his numbers were down. He is in the 80s to low 100s doing keto & fasting."
15,"I'd like to share a very positive experience with Metformin. I was diagnosed with Polycystic ovarian syndrome after very irregular periods and anovulatory cycles. I already worked out regularly and was a healthy weight. My husband and I tried for a very long time to conceive and were starting to lose hope. My doctor prescribed 1500mg per day. I experienced mild stomach discomfort and no other side effects. The first month, my cycle length was cut in half, and the second month, I got pregnant! I never thought the day would come that I would see a positive pregnancy test. I continued the Metformin through my first trimester, and we now have a perfect baby boy. Keep your head up and give it a try...I am so thankful that I did!"
16,"This medication has changed my life! I only regret that I did not take it sooner (like in my 20s). After suffering through years of acne and struggling to get pregnant when I wanted (frustrating business when you're not ovulating at all) and people constantly asking if I was pregnant (due to my big fat tummy that I could never get rid of), I finally found Metformin. Now, not only has my skin cleared up, my weight also came off, and I was able to have my beautiful 4th child easily because my periods have become bang on regular. I am so blessed to have had four children with polycystic ovarian syndrome, but it was a long road trying for most of them. This medicine has changed my life in that it has given me ME back - the confident me I am supposed to be."
17,"I tried regular metformin and the extended release, and my stomach just cannot handle it. I had severe stomach cramping and uncontrollable diarrhea...meaning when it hit, there was no warning and no time to get to the bathroom. I tried with meals, with milk, without meals, and nothing could allow me to tolerate it."
18,"I just started metformin 16 days ago. Explosive bowel motion probably most accurately describes my initial experience. It already seems to be getting better. I've lost 21 lbs, 233 to 212, in the past 16 days. My blood sugar went from 300's to 90's."
19,"This drug gave me terrible stomach cramps that would start 3 hours after each dose, followed by watery diarrhea for hours! I searched for answers and suggestions and found one to be my saving grace! Eat half your meal, take your pill, and then finish your second half of the meal. This equals no more stomach cramps and no diarrhea!"
20,"I have a mental illness, and the meds I'm on caused me to gain a little extra weight. There was no way I wanted to change my mental health meds as I didn't want to fall back into the hospital again. Anyway, to cut the story short, I was prescribed metformin months ago. I was 98.2 kg. I am now 93.5 kg. I am happy I am losing the weight. I have cut down on all the junk foods and added more fruit and salads to my diet. It also has helped me with waking up during the night and wanting to eat. I hope to lose more, but time will tell."
21,"I’ve been on this medication for a short period of time. I’m taking 1000 mg of IR per day, and so far none of those scary side effects many people have mentioned. I’ve had mild stomach cramps and nausea that lasts maybe 10 minutes a day. Definitely a reduction in appetite, however. I also am having fewer mood swings, thank goodness. I’m really hoping this will help with weight loss! I will update this review in a month or two."
22,"My husband was diagnosed with Metabolic Syndrome and prescribed 4 metformin a day by an endocrinologist after being misdiagnosed by our GP for hypothyroidism for months and being extremely tired and depressed. He had gained so much belly fat... and was 207 and 5ft 3 in!, not good. But after being one month on the metformin, he lost 20 lbs. This was in addition to limiting carbs in his diet. He feels so much better. He has so much more energy. And the weight continues to melt right off of his belly. We are so glad we decided to go to the endocrinologist. He was spot on! In a few months, I will have my slim husband back."
23,"I've only been on Metformin for about a month and a half. I've lost about 12 lbs, which is pretty cool because I've never had any success with calorie counting or different diets. I do have stomach cramps, occasional diarrhea, and dizziness, but nothing too bad. I'm only on 500mg twice daily. I'm actually really amazed with this medication. It makes me feel fine, I have my energy back, not constantly craving sweets and caffeine. Overall, I have to give it a ten."
24,"When I was 28, I took Metformin. Within a month, I got pregnant. I have PCOS. I couldn't figure out why all these years I couldn't get pregnant, so the doctor did blood work. And it was my insulin because I have PCOS. And now I am 30. I just started back taking the Metformin again because I'm trying to have another baby. And I'm taking prenatal vitamins. Good luck on trying to get pregnant. Sending baby dust y'all's way. And mine."
25,"I hadn't been to the doctor in years for a regular checkup. I noticed that over the course of 10 years, I had steadily gained weight despite eating fairly healthy. I chalked it up to menopause and stress. I went to my PCP because I was having anxiety issues. She ran labs. I was told that I was 'obese,' my A1C was 6.4, and my glucose was 100 (I had just eaten lunch). I was put on a 500 mg dose with dinner. I haven't changed my diet, I was already eating fairly healthy, but I have lost 10 pounds in 10 days! I was light-headed the first few nights and had loose stools around day 3. But other than that, I feel great! I will report back after my next A1C check in May."
