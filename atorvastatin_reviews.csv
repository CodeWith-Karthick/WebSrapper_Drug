Serial No.,Review
1,"So I went to the doctor for peripheral neuropathy and back spasms. She did my blood work, and my cholesterol is extremely high. She put me on generic Lipitor, and it made my back spasms even worse. Now my upper back has a tremor that still hasn't gone away even after quitting the drug 2 months ago. I have lost strength in my legs and I have terrible short-term memory. It gave me dizzy spells, and I just felt sick all the time. I'm still recovering from it, and I told my doctor I quit taking it because it was making me shake. Now she wants me to start taking it again, but I'm not going to."
2,"After taking Lipitor for a few weeks, I developed pain in both my legs, arms, and shoulders. After three months, all my muscles were heavy and underpowered. I could hardly exercise. I stopped taking Lipitor, and some three months later, I am nearly back to normal! Don’t take these drugs because it defeats the object. You need to exercise to reduce cholesterol, however, these drugs prevent you from doing so!"
3,"Delayed side effects. Took years to realize statins give memory loss BIG TIME and muscle pain and mood issues. And now discovering risk from high LDL is massively exaggerated. Having sufficient HDL is what matters. If you know someone losing memory, ask them to think back if it started getting worse within a year of starting statins. Someone once did that for me."
4,"5 urgent care and 2 ER trips, and no one related the Lipitor to my pains. I had bad muscle cramps everywhere. Muscle cramps causing pain in glute muscles that had me in physical therapy. Itching and tingling on face and extremities. Also pain in various muscles that concludes with lasting aches and difficulty with motion. Fatigue too. Been on for over a year then looked up side effects and called my doctor. Took statin-specific blood test and have to have test to see if my muscle fibers have broken down. I'm a walking side effect commercial...and it's not fun."
5,"I took Lipitor for three weeks. Three days into the treatment, I had left knee and hip pain. I continued to take it for another 2 and a half weeks in hopes the issues would resolve. My cholesterol was normal on a retest. However, the pain in my hip, below my abdomen, and knee caused a really bad limp. I stopped taking the drug, and it took me 3 months and daily CoQ10 supplements to return my leg to normal. Since then, I have gone on a diet, lost 10 pounds, eliminated white sugar, and red meat from my diet. Hope that's enough. I would not recommend statins for anyone!"
6,"I took Lipitor for three months, then went through an unbelievably bad time for 3 years due to side effects. I had myopathy, neuropathy, rashes, upset stomach, extreme muscle pain, ED, constipation, arthritis, short-term memory loss, could not lift my arms above my head, and horrible fatigue."
7,"I was put on 20mg of Atorvastatin in April 2019 by a new Cardiologist. I started to feel fatigued the first week and lowered the dose to 10mg (split the pill). I was checked recently and my LDL was lower from 147 to 121 mg/dL. The last few months the side effects have started to really cause me problems, severe leg muscle cramps and pain in my upper arms. In the morning, I find that my voice is very hoarse, and this is starting to affect my speech pattern. I asked my own PCP about the side effects, and all he could tell me is that there are no other known remedies for lowering one's cholesterol. I decided after reading all the reviews that I would take a time out on this drug and try Niacin. I'm a 55-year-old healthy male who walks everywhere, and I can't afford to lose my mobility at such an early age. I really have no trust in the US Medical system and only see it as a money-making enterprise with an unsustainable bureaucracy."
8,"Terrible! After a few days on this drug, I started having moments of 'spacing out' - it was like my brain would go offline for a minute or two and suddenly reboot. Horrible feeling! Also, it is important to note that this drug is known to worsen symptoms of GERD (which I have). Lipitor made my GERD so bad that I was vomiting for hours after eating or drinking anything. I have tried it twice and had the same reaction both times. No thanks!"
9,"Took Lipitor for about 5 years. It kept my lipids under control well, but developed really bad leg aching and muscle cramps, especially at night. Went off it and within a week, all these reactions disappeared."
10,"Been taking 10 mg for 6 months. Edema in legs and feet, so sore I can barely walk. Had similar reactions a couple of years ago, and all symptoms went away quickly when I stopped meds. Statins sneak up slowly on me, side effects took some time to develop, but I finally figured it out. Within 2 days of stopping the statin, my edema went away, and much of the foot pain. It's been 5 days now, and I'm hoping there is no permanent damage. This is bad for my body in my opinion, so don't wait for your doctors to admit that this drug might be the problem. I suspect the incidence of bad effects is way underreported."
11,"Been taking 20mg for 3 months. Zero side effects. Triglycerides were 311. Most recent blood test showed 125, which is in normal range. Good cholesterol was 23. Now is 50. Very effective drug. Sorry to all those people who are having negative side effects. Try something else and good luck. All medications work for some and not others."
12,"My cardiologist finally talked me into taking this poison after 5 years of trying. Took it for a month. The first week I had severe cramping of my hamstrings. The second week foot, ankle, and knee pain. Fourth week all the previous symptoms with myopathy, back pain, and gout flare-ups. Stopped taking the poison(feel stupid I waited so long to do it). I had to walk with crutches for a week and after weeks still having trouble. I read an article that said 1 in 4 Americans take statins. However, because the “normal” cholesterol numbers are being lowered, which means more people will be diagnosed with high cholesterol, that statistic is going to change to 1 in 2 Americans. If I would have continued to take the poison, it probably would have helped to prevent me from having a heart attack or stroke. What good does that do me if I have a terrible quality of life by being crippled and miserable."
13,"The Lipitor worked for years then suddenly I had upper arm pains and couldn't move my arms without crying. I couldn't get up from the toilet or bathtub, etc. I was unable to look after myself. My cardiologist took me off the drug immediately and said not to ever go back to it. After months, the pain subsided a little but never came back to my original health. Can't walk much and have to stop every minute or so to rest my aching legs, etc. Can't take care of my apartment anymore."
14,"Been on this horrible tablet for two weeks and never felt as ill in my life. I am constantly feeling sick and dizzy and can’t lift my arms up. I stop taking them for one day and the next day I feel on top of the world, then take them again and on the day after back to normal feeling sick, dizzy, sinus problems will never take them again. I will get my cholesterol down myself."
15,"My doctor prescribed Lipitor (40mg) four months ago for high cholesterol of 342. I started feeling like my lower legs weighed a ton. Then it also went into my knees and behind the knees. The pain was unbearable, especially in the muscles circling the knee with bad pain above and towards the outer side of both knees. My doctor thinks it's from an injury I suffered 11 years ago and sent me for X-rays. I tried telling him it felt more like muscle than joint pain, but at this point, the pain was so bad that I wasn't even sure anymore. Confusion started a few weeks ago, where I was struggling to think of words. Three days ago, I quit taking it, and I slowly am feeling better. Thankfully I found these reviews today. Things are making more sense."
16,"I was put on Lipitor after a mild heart attack and stent placement. A short time after starting the script, my hands started hurting daily. They woke me up at night. Then the pain spread throughout my body. It got so bad I could not push up off a chair or bed. Nothing helped. It was nerve and muscle pain. Took it for a year before the doctor finally heard me and took me off Lipitor to see if that was the cause. Within days, the pain started letting up. Now 4 months later I'm back to normal. The pain was so bad I thought I was terminal and felt that way to the point of writing out a will. Not everyone has this reaction. But pay attention if you start taking it and then have body pain. It can be dangerous. I don't know what long-term effects may show up later from it. Now my hands still hurt daily from it. But less than when I was on the pill."
17,"I was put on atorvastatin as a middle-aged male with a history of moderate hypertension. I had low cholesterol and lower good cholesterol but was put on it. Over a few years, my blood sugar climbed to the point of being diagnosed as diabetic. Prior to starting taking atorvastatin, I had very low blood sugar. The company's website tells you it will make your blood sugar rise but not make you a diabetic. I also had leg pain and cramping along with weight gain. I ended up with a rise in weight, cholesterol, blood sugar, and then a heart attack. After convincing a new doctor I was having issues with it, I was taken off of it. My blood sugar has dropped out of the diabetic range, my cholesterol has dropped, my leg issues have subsided. I have lost weight. Thank you for listening, Doctor."
18,"Horrible drug! Was taking 40 mg once a day. Side effects were just terrible. Headaches, nauseous, dizzy, spacey, and just felt terrible overall. After a few months, I decided to cut my dose in half. The next morning still had some side effects but not nearly as bad as the prescribed dose I was on."
19,"I was taking the combination drug Caduet, of which Lipitor was one of the two drugs. Steadily over a year, my doctor increased the medication from 20mg to 40mg, and then about three months ago, he increased it to 80mg. Within a month, I was experiencing tiredness, and eventually muscle weakness, coupled with elevated CK readings. On doing some research on the drug, I found that the symptoms I had were indeed a major drug reaction. Although Lipitor helped in the reduction of my cholesterol levels, the side effects were debilitating. Within a week of having the medication changed to a non-statin, I was beginning to feel better. A month later, I am close to being back to my old self. There are other better alternatives."
20,"Don’t use this drug if your doctor prescribes it. Took this for 3 years after an acute myocardial infarction (MI), and now I have a condition called statin-induced myopathy, which is a wasting muscle disorder that is non-reversible and will eventually completely disable me."
21,"Wish I could rate this a zero. After only 3 days on atorvastatin 20mg, I experienced constant headache, muscle pain and weakness, dizziness, couldn't sleep, tingling in the arms and legs, and ringing in the ears. Well, turns out after doing more research into these toxic drugs, I was indeed being slowly poisoned. Stopped after 9 days and things are improving slowly. These drugs stop the essential HMG-CoA pathway in the body which produces many molecules that are essential for cellular health. They also build up in muscle tissue in their toxic lactone form. This is especially serious if you have acidic blood pH. There are genetic variations in the body's ability to clear these through the liver that can lead to a dangerous build-up of these drugs in your body. This basic biology is all hard science and confirmed by peer-reviewed studies. Educate yourself and make your own decision before letting your doctor scare you into taking these dangerous drugs."
22,"Taken before two other times for high cholesterol, I quit because of stomach pains and bloating. This time I took 40 mg for a week, it didn't seem to bother my stomach. I did notice wind, so I decided to quit again, it's just not worth the side effects. I'm not overweight, I don't eat greasy foods, I do eat and drink sugar every day. My cholesterol is very high. I'll ask my doctor if there is another medicine to try, does anyone have a suggestion? Thanks."
23,"My doctor prescribed me atorvastatin 10mg, 8 weeks ago. My numbers are in the 200s. I was very hesitant because of the bad side effects I have heard other people tell me about, but everyone is different, so I decided to give it a try. As of today, I took myself off of it. I have gained 12 lbs, experienced muscle weakness, muscle aches, back pain, brain fog, memory issues, confusion, headaches, and fatigue. I explained to my doctor that I was having bad side effects, and she told me to stay on it and just 'wait it out' and the good will outweigh the bad. I have become very inactive and sleep all the time. I haven't exercised at all, and with the weight gain, that has made my health deteriorate...not improve. I am going to try Niacin instead. In the long run, I realize that eating healthy and exercise is the best way to keep my body in the best shape possible. My health is important to me, but so is my quality of life. Try this drug at your own risk."
24,I have taken this for 8 years but it makes me feel like a zombie. And it affects my memory and motor skills. I recently went back to work and had to quit Lipitor because it affected my ability to work. Don't know what I will try next. Started on Crestor 9 years ago and couldn't stand the pain in my legs.
25,"This drug is the absolute worst in the world for me. I have been on it for five years or more and being in bad pain for three of those years. I have been on Tylenol three, Codeine Contin, and hydromorphone, and the doctor argued every time when I went in to get more pain meds. My legs have been in unbelievable pain for so long I can't honestly think of the time when I was not in pain. I just started reading about this and stopped taking Lipitor and told the doctor that I would never go back on it again. In about a month, I have started to feel better, but I am left with weak legs and a huge bill from the chiropractor, massage therapist, acupuncturist, exercise therapist, and naturopathic doctor. I have had three trips to the hospital emergency department with no help in the long run. I am very, very angry. I hope my lingering pain goes away soon."
