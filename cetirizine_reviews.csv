1,"I am a nurse who has been taking this for seasonal allergies and I wanted to write my review on Zyrtec. I noticed depression in mood, weight gain, sluggish bowels, and some urinary retention. All my seasonal allergy symptoms did not subside to my satisfaction. When getting off Zyrtec, you may experience uncontrollable itching that you did not have before taking the med. I'll tell you how to get off it without the itch. Start taking 10mg of Claritin each night for two nights, then cut Claritin in half to 5mg and take for three more nights, then stop taking Claritin. That takes the itch away, and Claritin does not have the withdrawal itch. Once you stop Claritin and Zyrtec, you will quickly lose any weight you gained, and your mood should improve. Hope that helps."
2,"This medicine is absolutely awful. Please avoid! If you take it long term, you will experience the following: 1- weight gain 2- sleepiness 3- irritability 4- heart palpitations 5- severe anxiety 6- muscle twitches 7- hypertension 8- bloating 9- IBS. Those are serious side effects. I implore you to do everything you can to avoid taking this stuff. On a positive note, once you quit, all those symptoms will clear within a few days to a week. PS: when you quit, you may experience severe Pruritus, please wait it out and refrain from popping another pill, I promise you it will go away despite how miserable it can be. It is like withdrawing from a real drug, which is scary. It will subside."
3,"Zyrtec is one strange drug. I've taken it and gotten allergy relief, other times it causes major mood swings. Today is the worst. I took it before bed and woke up feeling exhausted. Then had a minor problem but got totally enraged. I've already eaten breakfast and lunch, taken two naps, but I have no energy and still feel like anything and everything will set me off. I don't take anything else, I've had no alcohol. The only factor is the Zyrtec. This medication is dangerous and needs to be removed or have more clear warnings."
4,"I took Zyrtec for six months, and then I had to stop five days before my allergy testing. There absolutely needs to be a warning and side effect statement by Zyrtec informing people about going through withdrawal! After 48 hours of stopping it, I had uncontrollable itching all over my body. It was miserable, embarrassing, and literally felt like I was going crazy! You have no control over it. The only way to stop it is to take another Zyrtec... it’s exactly like being addicted to pills! It’s all over the Internet, and the FDA has buried some of the information on their website. It’s a terrible, terrible side effect. The itching is generalized... bottom of your feet, palms of hands, scalp, legs, etc., and sometimes you scratch until you bruise. There really needs to be a class action lawsuit against Zyrtec. Please read about it. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone!!!"
5,"I stopped Zyrtec after 4 years of fairly continuous usage, because I was getting terrible rhinitis unresponsive to Zyrtec. I now have Zyrtec withdrawal itching - calling it utter nightmare is an understatement. I'm itching everywhere. It's unbearable. I haven't slept for 3 days. I'm on the verge of tears as I type this. This is traumatizing."
6,"Quitting Zyrtec is the worst! For 4 days now, I itch everywhere. Really wanting to chop my hands and feet off. Trying not to give in, but this is hell. Once this is under control, I will NEVER use Zyrtec again. Wish I knew about this before I started."
7,"I have been taking Zyrtec daily for allergies for a year or more. I have tried to stop, and like many others, I get extreme and intense itching. Scratching does not help and makes large red spots. It does not stop and is a horrible feeling. I also had chest and back pain after stopping. It's horrible, and you should not take it. Crazy that they allow this drug. Others posted about weight gain and being tired. This is also something that I have and may have been caused by this drug. Anyway, I have been off it for 3 days. I am hoping this nightmare stops soon because it is a horrible feeling."
8,"Stay away from this drug (Zyrtec) for seasonal allergies - there are better alternatives. While taking Zyrtec, especially if you are older, you may experience dry mouth and accelerated dental caries among others (drowsiness, headache, constipation, and miscellaneous other adverse effects). Upon discontinuing Zyrtec, you may experience disabling generalized and severe itching without a rash or sometimes with a rash. The itching can occur anywhere on your body - but almost always on the palms and soles. The itching is often severe and unrelenting and often is not associated with a rash. The itching can last for days and weeks. The FDA is aware of this 'Zyrtec withdrawal syndrome,' but to date does not appear too concerned about it. Several hundreds of cases have been reported."
9,"My kids and I have taken Zyrtec for years. It has worked wonderfully for us all, but... It wasn't until my most recent migraine that I realized Zyrtec was making us deathly ill. It dawned on me that my migraines occurred once a month right when we ran out of Zyrtec. The horrible migraines were withdrawal symptoms! I immediately stopped giving it to my kids and taking it myself. Yes, nose started dripping and I have little hives on my arm, but OMG I haven't felt this good in YEARS. No joke, since all 4 of us have stopped taking it, we've all lost weight. I've lost about 7-10 lbs in a month. My kids' clothes are almost too big. My head is CLEAR, no fog, no drowsy, groggy feeling. I feel like myself again. Do not take Zyrtec!"
10,"I am taking Zyrtec for over 4 years, almost every 1 to 2 days or as needed (Allergic doctor's suggestion). It makes me feel relief of the itching and pollen symptoms, but if I stop taking it, my whole body starts to react - itching everywhere and producing stress on me. I'm trying to quit this medication little by little. Drinking a lot of water with mint plant (3 L.) daily. IT WORKS, BUT NOT EASY AT ALL. I increased 1 day each time after taking the Zyrtec and believe it's not easy, but I ignored the side effects and drank a sip of water each time my body itched. Slowly decreasing. I have gone 8 days without taking this medication. Other than light itching, insomnia, headaches, and muscle stress are side effects so far. I will keep going ahead. Pharmaceuticals business using us to keep doing their income. It might have a natural replacement, if you know, please share!"
11,"This has been the worst medication I have ever been on. My symptoms are EXTREME upper back pain, brain fog, memory problems, fatigue like crazy, anxiety like crazy, and just an overall feeling that something is terribly not right in my brain. I can’t even tell you how I feel. I feel drugged up, but in the worst possible way. My mom actually looked at me and said I seem off. This med worked great for my post-nasal drip, but I will never take this ever again or any long-acting antihistamine. I did not feel this way at first, it’s like this awful med built up in my body, and I’m noticing symptoms now, and it’s terrible. I can’t get it out of my body fast enough!!"
12,"I've had a hellish experience with eustachian tube dysfunction for the past few days and trying different antihistamines just to stop it, and none worked. Then I took cetirizine. 15-30 mins later, ALL HEALED. JUST LIKE THAT. Amazing. Just a point to look out for: sometimes it can make you drowsy, so look out for that."
13,"I have been on a combination of Allegra/Pepcid in the morning and Zyrtec/Pepcid in the evening for the past 4 years. I developed chronic idiopathic dermatographism after I had my son. I had a negative and very itchy reaction to the epidural, but I've not been able to pinpoint whether that was the initial cause of my current problem or if there is an underlying issue still at hand. Five doctors have not been able to find out what is wrong with me. I've had allergy testing, blood tests galore, thyroid examinations, etc. I'm now at the point where I don't know if Zyrtec just works so great or if I'm so addicted to it that I can't get off of it. Every night when it's time to take it, I feel like (what I would assume) a person coming off hardcore drugs feels like. The itching is bad. I'm now on day two of trying to detox myself from it, and I'm losing my mind. Never take this stuff. Ever. I wish I would have never started."
14,"This drug is horrific. I’ve been taking Zyrtec daily for about 3 years. It got to the point where my allergies were still so bad that the medication wasn’t even lasting me 24 hours. I did not want to begin taking injections, so I started skipping 2-3 days to see if that would help build my tolerance back up. I’ve been googling itchy palms and soles for months, years, trying to figure out where this was coming from! I finally found the answer, it is Zyrtec withdrawal! I’ve been off of it for 9 days now, and I’m still experiencing severe itching all over my body! Other symptoms included moodiness, weight gain, brain fog, dizziness, and overall dependence on the drug. Zyrtec causes crazy withdrawals! I also feel like my allergies were worse taking this medication, I would get extreme congestion and itchy eyes. Both of those two symptoms have gone away since getting off this medication and removing dairy from my diet. I would rather heal from a low histamine diet than ever take this drug again!"
15,"I had hives for 3 weeks, and I was completely miserable! I was put on steroids for 3 days, and they came back as soon as I quit them. I was taking Benadryl every day and was still so itchy. About ready to go nuts, I researched and researched things to try. Into week 3 with the hives, I started taking Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Vitamin B12 and drinking green tea every day. Took a Zyrtec one morning, and my hives were cleared by evening. I have been taking 1 a day for 3 days now, and I'm hive-free, feeling great."
16,"There is not a single good enough reason to start taking Zyrtec. I’ve tried to quit multiple times, and I end up having to take it again because of the relentless itchiness. On top of that, it makes you quite drowsy and doesn’t fix the allergy symptoms I started taking it for. Since trying to quit for the 3rd time, I’ve also experienced severe headaches and neck pain. Weaning yourself off seems to be the best option."
17,"Took Zyrtec for over 10 years. 35-year-old female. I have bad dust and seasonal allergies. It has always been incredibly helpful. I recently read that long-term use of antihistamines can affect brain health, so I decided to quit to see if I notice any changes. Something different happened. I am on day 6 without Zyrtec, and it has been miserable. I had no idea what was going on given the pandemic. I’m nauseous, foggy, my tattoos are raised, my upper arms and shoulders are swollen, my scalp is itching and extremely sensitive, my palms and fingers are itching, and I have bruising on my arms. I finally googled Zyrtec withdrawal, and there it is, exact symptoms. The bruises are from scratching. Today I discovered tiny bumps in the places that have been itchy. I’m wondering how long this will last. Advice: don’t take Zyrtec long-term. If you have been, lower your dosage slowly. Don’t be a hero and go cold turkey. I wouldn’t have, but I’m already so many days into it, I figure it has to stop at some point."
18,"Been trying to quit Zyrtec for 6 years. The Zyrtec withdrawal itch is so intense the longest I've made it without caving and taking a pill is 6 days. 6 days of relentless itching. It's the worst in the palms of my hands. If you haven't yet, don't take Zyrtec. The withdrawal feels like your entire body is covered in mosquito bites. I don't know how long it lasts, but I know it's at least 6 days."
19,"I would like to share my experience using Zyrtec to make anyone who may consider stopping it aware that it can cause severe itching when stopped. Although taking Zyrtec most definitely relieves my allergy symptoms, when I had to stop it because of allergy testing, within a couple of days of stopping Zyrtec, I broke out into an itchy rash that drove me crazy for days and nights. It caused me a lack of sleep for a while. So please, for anyone considering using Zyrtec as your choice of allergy relief medicine, be aware that stopping it could cause severe itching and discomfort."
20,"I get monthly allergy shots and was told to take a daily allergy pill as well. Originally, I was taking Claritin but was told by my allergist that I should take Zyrtec because it is stronger. Fine. So I've been taking a Zyrtec every day and needed to go off it to take a new allergy skin test. I lasted 3 days before I started on the Zyrtec again. After 48 hours of not having it in my system, I started with unbearable itching all over. I thought it could be my new dog until I did a Google search and realized no, my body was going through withdrawal symptoms from the Zyrtec. No one ever told me this was a possibility. DO NOT TAKE THIS DAILY FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. Now I have to wean myself off this drug."
21,"Zyrtec relieved me of my allergies (except for my worst days), but the side effects were horrible—drowsiness being the worst. I took it at night, however, it still made me so drowsy during the day that in school I fell asleep in every class. Eventually my friends convinced me to stop taking it because they had experienced the same thing."
22,"I've had dermatographism or chronic urticaria for about 1 year before I started taking Zyrtec. I started taking Zyrtec in January, and now I forgot I even have the skin problem! When I first tried this product, the side effects made me extremely sleepy and thirsty. It dried my body out. But the side effects went away after prolonged use. Now I feel like a normal person!"
23,"Zyrtec works incredibly well for my severe ragweed allergy. However, each fall, I've noticed it's making me more and more drowsy, to the point that I don't want to do anything and I'm needing naps in the afternoon. I think I'm going to have to discontinue it, which is frustrating because it works much better than the other meds I've tried."
24,"I started taking Zyrtec for seasonal allergies. It seemed to help after a day or two, so I kept taking it. But then I ran out and didn’t take any for a couple of days, and that night became severely itchy all over my hands, head, and chest. I thought I must be allergic to my new cats. I got a new bottle and started right back up the next day, no more itching. I was sure I was allergic to the cats! Then fast forward a few months and I’m consistently feeling very tired, irritable, have horrible headaches, jittery, plus other symptoms, so I looked up the side effects of the medication, and sure enough, they are all listed. I then stumbled upon people talking about the severe itching when stopping taking Zyrtec, and I realized I’m not allergic to my cats, it’s a VERY common thing when you stop taking the drug. I was shocked. I quit cold turkey and am on day 10 without it and am still itchy. It’s been awful, especially on my hands, chest, and scalp. My body feels like it’s burning all over at times."
25,"My doctor gave me a prescription for Zyrtec, and I took it for a month but realized that when I didn’t take my dose, my hands and feet would start itching uncontrollably. So, I took the Zyrtec, and the itching was gone, so that’s when I realized it was the Zyrtec that was causing my itch. So, I went to taking Claritin, and it did the same thing to me as the Zyrtec. Now I’m taking Xyzal, and I can’t stop taking it because my hands start to itch like crazy. Zyrtec was the medicine that started it all. So, I’m trying to wean myself off any of this allergy medicine."
