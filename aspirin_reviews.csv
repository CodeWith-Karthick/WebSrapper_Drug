Serial No.,Review
1,"My family has a history of heart attack, so I always carry aspirin with me just in case. I found a wristband on the market that stores 2 aspirin in it. It is a great and convenient method of carrying aspirin around, so I don't need a bulky bottle of it in my pocket. It is called the Beatfirst Aspirin Wristband for anyone else with the same problem."
2,"I am a 35-year-old male with moderate to severe sciatica (pain from buttock to ankle) due to a bulging disc L5 - S1. I found taking a 1000 mg dose gave significant and almost total relief for about 1 to 2 hours. The effect was greater if the pain was not too severe, the best results came from taking aspirin before the pain got severe. I also found that taking aspirin without food made it work faster, but I suffered stomach aches as a consequence."
3,"I have severe sciatica as a result of a cyst on L5. The epidural failed, gave relief for a week before pain returned, and I am headed toward surgery to remove the cyst. I have found aspirin works better than Aleve (2 every 8 hours or 3 every 12 hours per my doc is OK), Advil, and Tylenol, 10 mg Norco and Gabapentin, although I am stepping up bit by bit to a full dose of Gabapentin, and maybe eventually that will help. On a scale of 1-10 my pain is a 10, and the aspirin will cut it down to a 3-4 for a couple of hours."
4,"It works. I always take Bayer when I have a headache, and it always works. I took store brand aspirin for four days battling a headache, and it just did not work at all. Popped two expired Bayer today, and they still worked like magic on both my back pain from menstruation and the headache I haven't been able to get over. I feel so much better that I literally went online to write a review about it. If that doesn't convince you, I don't know what will. Try it, it works."
5,"I have been taking 3-325 mg enteric aspirin tablets in the AM and PM for 30 years. That is 975 mg per dose. When I have to go off aspirin for surgery, my hands get seriously inflamed, stiff, and painful. I have never had any stomach problems with enteric aspirin. Recently, aspirin has become hard to find in large quantities like Costco and Walgreens used to sell. In small quantities, it costs 3 times as much per tablet. Please, somebody return to selling it in large economy sizes."
6,"I have found that aspirin has been an amazing help with the arthritis pain that I have dealt with over the years. I donâ€™t know what got into me to give aspirin a try, but am I ever glad that I did! I had thought that naproxen was the best I could do for pain using over-the-counter medicines since it had been a prescription drug at the time it was prescribed for me several years ago. However, at least for my shoulder pain problem, it has been the other way around."
7,"I have rheumatoid arthritis and take an aspirin per day for my heart. It is effective in relieving headaches, especially quick if the tablet is chewed. Read the side effects to receive best results. Dosage I use is two, repeated as needed every few hours. This is based on my needs and experience."
8,"Aspirin is not a very effective pain reliever and has unacceptable side effects for me. Namely, gastritis and ulcer. I traded my daily ibuprofen for a daily aspirin after reading about its cardiovascular and cancer-preventing properties. A month later, my stomach is wrecked. I don't smoke, drink, or do anything else that would damage my stomach this way. I'm a healthy 30-year-old. My symptoms include nausea, burning pain in my back and shoulders, gas, bloating, indigestion, and weakness. I'm now taking Prilosec, Zantac, and Tums with little relief. While daily aspirin can save lives, it can also be harmful. It's slightly harder on your stomach than other NSAIDs. Don't take it unless you actually NEED it."
9,"It's the only aspirin product I can tolerate. All others, even 'coated' low-dose aspirin, cause GI upset. It's also significantly more expensive. For some reason lately, I have been having difficulty finding this product. That said, I'm glad I found an aspirin product that does not cause GI upset (I take it for stroke prevention, which is very rampant in my family)."
10,"This would be the second most effective NSAID for me, behind Motrin but well ahead of Aleve or other OTCs of any type. It is my preference for 'cold and flu' because it breaks a fever pretty quick. If there is a downside, it's that if I take 2 or 3 a day for more than a week, it definitely causes a ringing in my ears, loud. Short-term or simple pain, the old school aspirin just works."
11,"For one week, I have been suffering from progressive sciatica pain in my left leg when standing. For the last two days, it has been an '8' on the pain scale when standing, with no relief from Tramadol, ibuprofen, Tylenol, or naproxen sodium. Today, I tried Ecotrin 500 mg with some relief.... Hopeful..."
12,"I have rheumatoid arthritis in my shoulders and hands. My doc has had me try several different NSAIDs for it. I was having the best results with plain old ibuprofen. But I was having to take 16 - 20 200 mg tablets a day. I saw Stanback at a local discount store and got 2 boxes. I was suffering terribly from the shoulder and hand pain and was willing to try anything. I tried Stanback, and it was like a miracle for me! If you're not familiar with Stanback, it is a headache powder you can either take mixed with a liquid or pour straight on the tongue. It's very old school but works well and doesn't even taste bad."
13,"After having ulcers, the doctor recommended Bufferin for pain, that was 40 years ago. I have relied on that and Extra Strength Bufferin since then. Since it was taken off the market, I have tried others, but they do not work as well. Please, please bring the Bufferin back."
14,"I have tried many brands of aspirin, but for some reason, Bufferin works the best. Only one store in my vicinity carries it, so we buy two bottles when it is on the shelf. Bufferin keeps swelling down throughout my body and even helps my son with his acne in a most visible way. I am convinced that there must be different grades of aspirin because Bufferin works better than the others."
15,"Have tried Motrin, Aleve, Tylenol for back pain, and nothing works as well. Take it with food and take a brand that is coated, and even the few side effects are lessened. It's still the safest and most effective in my personal view."
16,I have used this aspirin for about 30 years to help with rheumatoid arthritis. I miss it terribly when I have to stop it for tests or medical procedures. The coating helps to keep it from hurting my stomach.
17,"Aspirin is a wonder drug. If you take it with food, it won't hurt your stomach. I take Anacin (which is just another brand of aspirin). It has a small amount of caffeine. It works great. It reduces my back pain in only an hour. I take just half an Anacin tablet (half of a 400 mg pill) once per day. Anacin has been on the market for over 100 years."
18,I have been using 150 mg of aspirin every day for the last 4 years. I have confirmed diabetes and borderline high blood pressure. I don't find any side effects. The rest of the health parameters are okay.
19,"The aspirin may be beneficial to my heart condition but the side effects are unbearable. I was already on warfarin with no side effects. Combined with the aspirin my dose of warfarin was reduced. Since adding the aspirin my periods have become so long and heavy and I can't leave the house for 2 weeks at a time unless I have access to a bathroom every hour. Besides waking up every hour during the night to change protection, I'm exhausted and weak from the blood loss. I take 2 iron supplements a day to keep afloat. Probably a very easy-to-use drug for anyone without a working uterus."
20,"All the different NSAIDs and OTC painkillers have a different effect for sure. I prefer this kind over some others. This does well to reduce my fevers. And it seems to be easier on my intestines than some others. I like it. If I am in bed with a fever, drink a glass of watered-down juice, eat a slice of bread and cheese. Take a dose, and lay down. Hopefully, sleep!"
21,"Due to  intestinal bleeding, I cannot take typical NSAIDs for heart attack preventative care.  However, because of the 'buffering'/magnesium in this product, I can, but in small doses.  I cannot find 81 mg of Bufferin so I take a 326 mg tablet and quarter it, taking it in the evening, 98% of the time without a bleeding problem.  When I have joint pain, I may double it but then bleeding can become a problem, again."
22,"What I told my Physical Therapist today, about what Tylenol does as far as helping my pain goes, that it curbs the sharp, piercing, type of pain that is not tolerable. My Chronic Osteo, plus many Fractures, Replacements and Removals. Told I have very, thin, long Bones, and Painful, Avascular Necrosis. I also have had many injuries, most recently, from Seizures, slips and falls. Suggestions for the best Pain Meds. for regular 7- 10 Pain #'s ? Unmanageable."
23,"I liked it at first until I started seeing bruising on different parts of my body like on arm. I will discontinue use for it to stop. Not 100% sure this caused it, but when I started meds that's when I saw it. Anyone else notice this?"
24,"I have used Arthritis Strength BC powder for years, and it definitely helps me get through the day. It is a 1000 mg powdered aspirin in an envelope and is fast-acting because of the powdered form. I take it at least once a day."
