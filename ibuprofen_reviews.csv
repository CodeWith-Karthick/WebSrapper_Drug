Serial No.,Review
1,"It ONLY WORKS if you stay ahead of the pain. I've had 2 different lower jaw teeth removed at different periods in my life and the pain was too much for 800mg Ibuprofen. Both times I felt like a junkie begging for drugs from my dentist. Really?! You just dug around in my jawbone for 25 minutes and obliterated the soft tissues of my gum and want to treat me like a drug seeker when this Ibuprofen isn't cutting it? It absolutely confuses me how so many people have access to all of these painkillers but when you actually have a procedure that is likely to have massive pain you have to beg, use Ibuprofen, or suffer terrible pain OR take dangerous amounts of OTC concoctions hoping for relief. Stop doing this to people."
2,"My period is extremely painful. I have to take 800 mg ibuprofen 3 times a day to get relief. Sometimes even 800 mg doesn't work if I don't catch it early. Starts working around 40-60 mins, sometimes later. But if it really kicks in, I feel great for like 6-8 hrs. I have to laugh when somebody explains their cramps as horrible, but then say 1-2 pills a day save them. Girls, you are so lucky."
3,"I have chronic gout problems, been having for 15 years. Advil works well for my back pain and most of the time for joint pain if taken at the first feeling of gout flare. Taking four 200mg capsules at a time."
4,"800 mg helped with my pain. It takes about an hour to work, then pain is manageable. I have minimal side effects, a little headachy and slightly tired. I can take this and get relief without feeling drugged."
5,"I don't know why the rating for this medication is so low, unless it is because people just haven't tried it, in which case I would highly recommend doing so. These are my go-to, the liquid medicine means it works faster, and though you can't cure tooth pain fast enough, I can always count on these taking the edge off. I don't bother taking anything else!"
6,"I have severe sciatica that is absolutely devastating to my lifestyle. I drive a lot, and the pain is excruciating. 800 mg of ibuprofen provides relief in about an hour to an hour and a half, and from a dose to pain returning is about 3 to 3 and a half hours. It's not much, but it's the only thing giving me a respite from what is otherwise excruciating pain. I'm starting to get routine heartburn for the first time in years after taking this routinely for three months. Starting to worry about the stomach side effects. Can also be hard on the kidneys."
7,"Been taking ibuprofen 800 mg 3x a day, and always with food. A PA urged me to go off of it last Mon (now Wed) and replace it with tramadol; said he didn't know anyone who didn't get stomach ulcers or have kidney problems when on ibuprofen for an extended period. Each day pain grew worse until today I could hardly get out of bed as the pain was excruciating. Cooked breakfast in a hurry, switched back to ibuprofen, and now pain-free by noon."
8,"I had excruciating pain in both legs after slipping down a few stairs. It lasted about a week, and at that time, I decided to go to the hospital. It was sciatica. I was told to take ibuprofen for 3 days. I believe 600 mg every 8 hours, and I couldn't believe how great I felt. I have it again and just taking two 200 mg every 8 hours and starting to feel relief. This time was probably worse."
9,"A lot of people, such as myself, have been to the dentist to get a wisdom tooth pulled, and I'm looking for something to reduce/stop the pain, and ibuprofen sucks like I never even took anything... The pain swallows the pill."
10,"I have used Advil to treat my gout for years. I start off with 3 when there's pain, then 2 every 6 hours throughout the 1st day. Beyond that, I keep it within the recommended dosage of no more than 1200/day, and I typically do that much for the first 3-5 days after an attack occurs. I use the rapid release kind, or it doesn't work at all."
11,"I am a 35-year-old male with moderate to severe sciatica (pain from buttock to ankle) due to bulging disc L5 - S1. I found taking a 400 mg dose gave significant but not total relief for about 2 to 3 hours. The effect was greater if the pain was not too severe, the best results came from taking ibuprofen before the pain got severe. I also found that taking ibuprofen without food made it work faster, but I suffered moderate diarrhea as a consequence."
12,"Didn't work. I took 2 as the first dose because I have intense menstrual pain, but nothing happened. I waited for an hour before taking another one, hoping it would kick in, yet still nothing happened. I guess I can't say I'm surprised; nothing has ever helped my cramps. At this point, I just need to see a doctor ASAP."
13,"This drug works wonders. I got all 4 wisdom teeth extracted two days ago, and on the first night, I had no pain, but the second night at around 4:00 am, I started getting the worst pain I've ever felt that kept me from sleeping. The first thing I thought of was ibuprofen. I quickly went downstairs to get some. I'm 5'3"
14,"Been there, done that. I've tried everything there is to offer for tooth pain with zero results. I have a huge hole in a lower wisdom tooth as we speak. When waiting to get into the poor man's dentist, it can take a month or more. (Based on income) I have 2 more weeks, and I am counting down the minutes."
15,"This is the go-to medicine for me for a frozen shoulder. I was given meloxicam first, but I couldn’t handle the side effects of muscle pain and insomnia. I started the ibuprofen three days after stopping the meloxicam, and the pain relief and stiffness were greatly relieved. I take 400 mg a day, and no more, because that’s what works for me. If I do take more, I become restless with no added pain relief, so why bother."
16,Absolutely could not have survived the pain and inflammation without this drug. It is gentle and safe enough to take 800 mg with food. The liquid gels seem to work (get into my system) much quicker than just plain ibuprofen.
17,"Advil Liquid Gel is the only pain reliever that has worked for me. I pop a 400 mg every 6 hours or so for the first three days of my period. I suggest also, if your heavy flow happens on days off when you don't have to leave the house, try just making yourself comfy and sitting on the toilet all day and let things keep flowing out. It definitely makes a huge difference, especially when combined with Advil that now I have a dedicated pillow, blanket, foot stool, and phone charger stashed in my washroom cupboard."
18,"I asked my pharmacist what the best over-the-counter treatment for arthritis swelling was. He recommended the Advil. I took one capsule at noon, it is close to midnight, and my swelling has gone down considerably, the pain has as well."
19,"Works great to reduce fever. For pains caused by fever, I recommend taking 400 mg of ibuprofen (Advil) with 1000 mg of acetaminophen (Tylenol). The two work well with each other and are safe to use together."
20,"I have chronic migraines and my Dr. prescribed me 800 mg of ibuprofen 3 times a day or as needed, and let me tell you... Within 5 mins, my migraine literally melts away. I can't live without it, it really helps my condition."
21,"I had a bad flare-up with my gout. I tried Colcrys and indomethacin. I still had severe pain. Then I purchased Advil 200 mg × 4. That was the key in addition to the Colcrys. Within a day, my swelling went down, and by the next day, I was walking without pain."
22,"Ibuprofen 600 or 800 is a great pain reliever. Although I've taken many pain medicines over the years, ibuprofen I find to be just as effective as the strong controlled substances. It's a good anti-inflammatory too. Works great for severe menstrual cramps and tooth pain as well."
23,"Ibuprofen is wonderful for period pain, takes an hour to work and I take 2 x 200 mg tablets every 8 hours. Have been taking ibuprofen for a few years now and it's always done the job so far, until this week, that is. I was admitted to the hospital with an immune system that almost shut down because of a reaction to ibuprofen. I consider myself very lucky that I did a routine blood test and found out this information, was told to stop taking the medicine immediately. Please be careful even if you've taken this medicine on a number of other occasions as I have done."
24,"Ibuprofen has been my first line of treatment for gout attacks for 30 years and always works quickly and fast. If I take ibuprofen during the week for normal aches and pains, it also seems to prevent attacks. Every time a doctor has instructed me to stop taking ibuprofen before or after a procedure, I wind up having a gout attack. If I can't take the ibuprofen or any other NSAID, then I have used colchicine, it works, but I get serious nausea and diarrhea after one day. I get quick and complete relief from a methylprednisolone steroid pack."
25,I've found that taking ibuprofen (200 mg) several times daily reduces the shoulder and upper arm pain (both shoulders) and permits more flexibility. The length of time that its effect lasts is perhaps five or six hours at most...not quite long enough to get a full night's comfortable sleep.
