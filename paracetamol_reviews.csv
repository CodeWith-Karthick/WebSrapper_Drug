1,"I rate it 5. I've had a very high fever, and after taking Paracetamol, it only made it worse. That is why they suggested me to take Paracetamol every 4 hours. As a result, my fever is now gone, but my stomach is suffering. I currently have stomach/intestinal disturbances due to Paracetamol. This medicine is 50:50."
2,"Paracetamol. The only thing that works for me without any side effects, takes about 20 minutes to kick in, fantastic for muscle pain and anxiety attacks and insomnia. I take two 500 mg tablets every 4 hours (four times a day), for two days, then I'm okay."
3,It is the absolute worst painkiller to take when you have period pain. It did not ease my period pain at all. I would not recommend it to anyone. Don't touch it. I am very lucky now that I do not take Paracetamol anymore.
4,"I have found Tylenol and other equivalents to be relatively ineffective in reducing pain associated with my degenerative disk disease (neck pain, severe headaches, lower back pain). I have had some success with tramadol coupled with muscle relaxants, Tylenol with codeine, and Vicodin (5 and 7.5 mg). I also had good results with Aleve until I started to have stomach problems."
5,"Administered an IV bolus of 600 mg of Paracetamol to a patient in severe to moderate pain, and the patient suddenly started sleeping off, but that was not expected, so I checked and found the pulse unrecordable and BP not measurable. Quickly gave an IV bolus of saline and restored vitals, and subsequently monitored the patient for the next six hours. I think the effect of rapid administration IV should be hammered on."
6,Paracetamol is a very fine medicine.
7,Paracetamol is the best and safest drug. It's really amazing.
8,"It's for fever and muscle pain. It's the best if you have muscle pain after training or the next day. 30 minutes after taking the pill, you will be just fine."
9,Paracetamol has no pain-relief effect on me whatsoever.
10,Does not work. Made me more ill than I am.
11,Helps lower my blood sugar. I take 500 mg a day. I live in the UK.
12,"I had a headache, and it didn't help me one tiny bit, it just made my headache 100 times worse."
13,"For me, it's very good for pain and headache. Works in 30 minutes with everything getting better."
