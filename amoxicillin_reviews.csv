Serial No.,Review
1,"I've suffered frequent UTIs and am usually prescribed amoxicillin, which for me works amazingly well. If I catch it early, I find the ache in my bladder, small amount of blood in the urine, and the urgency to pee goes away enough to be comfortable within 6 hours, and I feel 100% normal again in 24-48 hours. Does the trick each time."
2,"I had been having abdominal and pelvic pain for over three weeks, thinking that it was menstrual-related. Once my cycle was over, I noticed that there was blood in my urine and immediately knew that it was a urinary tract or bladder infection. I got a prescription for amoxicillin, and within an hour of taking the first dose, which was two pills, my pain had subsided from an 8 to a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. Several hours later, I was immediately feeling back to myself and ready to get out and start living again. The pain of the bladder infection or urinary tract infection had literally kept me in the house with a heating pad on for three weeks, almost a month. Make sure that you do take the full Rx for the infection, or it could come back."
3,"I have always used amoxicillin for my frequent urinary tract infections. It works in 4 or 5 days, although I take it for a 10-day run. I take two 250mg capsules twice a day. I have never had any problems. Works great, if you aren't allergic to any of the penicillin-type drugs."
4,"I have a tooth infection and swelling on my face spreading to my neck. Now on my second dose of amoxicillin 500 mg. It's not working, can't see the dentist with COVID-19. What do I do now? I am scared if the infection goes into my bloodstream as that's very, very dangerous!"
5,"At first, I was convinced the antibiotic will not work as the pain felt like it was getting worse every day, and I was ready to go back to the dentist. Only after completing 4 out of 7 days (3 pills a day) did I start to feel better! Make sure you finish the entire course."
6,"Very effective, made me feel like normal again after weeks of being in pain due to my urinary tract infection. However, after being on amoxicillin for nearly 5 days, I had severe diarrhea and stopped taking it due to the fact, I was constantly sitting on the loo! However, this was a highly effective medicine for me, much better than trimethoprim."
7,"Have been on amoxicillin for a long time. Twice when I tried to quit it, exactly on the 10th day of being off it, I ended up with a bad urinary tract infection. So amoxicillin was very effective in holding off urinary tract infections for me."
8,"I have had frequent UTIs since I was a kid, and I still get them every couple of months. Amoxicillin has always worked for me. My doctor tried to change it up this time around and give me Bactrim. It was awful. It did nothing for my UTI, and just made me feel super dizzy and tired all day. So I went back, and she gave me Macrobid. I told her that amoxicillin has always worked for me, but she insisted I try the Macrobid. Still in constant pain, the frequency, all of it is still there. Amoxicillin is THE ONLY one that works for me. I am going back tomorrow and insisting on the amoxicillin. I KNOW MY BODY."
9,"So, I have had a tooth infection multiple times, but this time it’s worse to the point where I can’t eat or sleep. If I manage to fall asleep, I wake up in tears because of the pain. I have been taking Co-Codamol, Nurofen, and Paracetamol. I have also been using ice to try and numb my mouth. I had to ring up the dentist (due to COVID-19 I could not get an appointment) and explain my symptoms, which are swollen red gums, throbbing pain in the mouth and jaw, and tenderness when touching. I was prescribed Amoxicillin 500mg x3 a day. I have been taking them for 3 days now and the pain is still there, still swollen. The painkillers no longer work. I haven’t eaten in three days and everything hurts. The ice doesn’t make an impact, and I am just in severe pain day and night. I just think it’s a waste of time."
10,"My tooth broke, there was an infection and I was in HORRIBLE pain. I took 2 Ibuprofen 800mg & 1000mg of Tylenol (not good for me, I know) but I couldn’t handle the pain and it barely helped. I started the first dose of this antibiotic (850 mg twice a day) and the pain already subsided hours after taking it. I’ve used this medication before for tooth infections and it works WONDERS. I crush the antibiotic into yogurt and eat it that way, and it doesn’t upset my stomach at all. I wanted to write this review for all my hypochondriacs (like me). I’m literally scared of every medicine, I only take it if I absolutely must. But this antibiotic is totally worth it!"
11,"I was born with 4 kidneys, and it seems some of the other reviewers' side effects were actually kidney/bladder infection symptoms. These infections spread fast and can be lethal. Amoxicillin is a gentle savior for me, I still have 3 of 4 kidneys after surgery and countless urinary tract infections. I trust it very much. It can take as little as 2 days to go from UTI to bladder, and a day or so more to kidneys, nip it in the bud at the first stinging. Because if you start to feel constipated, it's probably not, that is a kidney infection symptom. These infections scare the daylights out of me. It has been quite a while since I was hospitalized, amoxicillin is safe and much easier on the body than cipro."
12,"Oh my, such a painful tooth infection top back molar. Crying waking up in the middle of the night with the pain. Cannot eat or bite down. Dentist has given me 5 days of amoxicillin and I am now on day 2. Reading through this thread gives me some hope that on perhaps day 4 I will be pain-free. Dental pain has got to be the worst."
13,"I started feeling better within half a day. This was good because I had been suffering for 6 days trying to get to the doctor. I feel much better now with no side effects. I had a terrible reaction in the past to Cipro, so I was happy to try another medicine that worked better for me."
14,"I'll start off by saying, I have a severe phobia of anything to do with vomit. This is relevant because I EXTENSIVELY research anything I have to put into my body, and I'll be honest, these reviews put me off taking my amoxicillin for a few days. I had a tooth infection, so I had to take a 500 mg pill every 8 hours for 7 days. To prepare myself, I bought some antibiotics, 4% fat cottage cheese, and yogurt. Two hours after each antibiotic, I took one probiotic pill. I experienced constipation and stomach cramps for one night. As someone who turns into a GIANT baby whenever they have any kind of tummy issues, I can honestly say it was bearable. Please don't take in all the negative reviews you read and be scared like I was. This antibiotic is very common, and so many people use it every single day. People tend to leave reviews more often if they're negative. That's why I'm writing this out! Have a great day, everyone!"
15,"I've had many bladder infections over the years, to varying degrees-- and Amoxicillin has always worked for me, personally, when it comes to the worst of them. But everyone is different, so if it doesn't help your infection go away, switch to another antibiotic, but be warned that the current push is to prescribe a powerful class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolone, that have a rare, but potentially permanent side effect of nerve damage (and warning states that the effect can happen AFTER you've taken the medication). So, given the choice of antibiotics, I'd take Amoxicillin first. Yes, there are side effects, but minor and temporary. Just take probiotics, eat well, hydrate."
16,"So, Amoxicillin works fantastic for a UTI, BUT I'd never ever take it without a probiotic. I get a bottle of acidophilus (maybe a few billion cultures) at a big box store for under $6. The reason being is antibiotics kill bacteria, both good and bad. My daughter gets thrush, and I've NEVER had a yeast infection until on amoxicillin for over 3 days. These are side effects of good bacteria being killed off. My doctor advised me on this, and I've never had any more side effects!"
17,"I really thought it was my sinuses. My left side of my face was throbbing and full of pressure, as well as my jaw and chin, gums and teeth hurt to the touch. I kept taking the real Sudafed, Benadryl, and Tylenol. Did not even put a dent in relief. Went to the dentist on Thursday, May 2nd, 2019. Saw a massive infection in the bottom gum, hole in the tooth, and infection in the jawbone! Talk about pain! I took two 500 mg Amoxicillin as soon as I got the bottle. Then 1 every 8 hours. It's now Saturday and what a difference. Jaw still sore beyond belief but not throbbing. Ecstatic is how I feel now. Tired, shaky, moody, stomach pain, but that does not compare to a severe infection that spread to root and bone. Amoxicillin does work."
18,"I was prescribed 500 mg of amoxicillin 3 times a day for severe pain in my tooth that I'd rate a 10/10 for the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. I'm a 34-year-old female who's gone through a c-section, and that pain does not even compare to this pain. I was also prescribed 800 mg of ibuprofen, which barely helped, as well as taking 1000 mg of Tylenol, which also barely made a dent in my pain. I started the medication Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving and didn't get much relief until Saturday morning when it was entirely gone. I would gargle salt water and tried Orajel, but the only thing that really got me through was constantly sipping and swishing ice-cold water. It kept my mouth numb enough that I could handle, but I was literally swishing every 5 minutes, and it definitely helped. I'm currently on day 3 and was finally able to enjoy a plate of Thanksgiving leftovers! Just give the medication some time to work and definitely keep a bottle of ice-cold water with you at all times!"
19,"This stuff works! But here’s something I would like to share with other people experiencing dental-related pain, which I’ve had a lot of over the years... Your sinuses play a role in the equation. Sinus pressure can exacerbate dental pain. It will likely be uncomfortable while you do it, but try massaging your sinuses upwards and out. Massage the muscles at your temple. Feel around your face and head. You’ll find points that are particularly sensitive. Dental pain can resonate throughout your head, and massaging your sinuses and head can be a tremendous help! At times, it has actually minimized my pain because the sinus pressure was making the pain worse, and once I massaged my sinuses (upwards and out), the pressure was relieved. I did this in conjunction with ibuprofen and a heating pad. Of course, it won’t cure it, only the appropriate dental work is going to solve it, but in many cases doing this will help to minimize your suffering in the meantime."
20,"Only used this to cure my UTI so it wouldn't spread to a kidney infection. But the side effects are absolutely horrific! I can't deal with this much longer. I'm supposed to take 500 mg/3x a day for 7 days, but I'm cutting it short. I'll do it for 5 days because it's day 3, and I already want to stop it. My side effects: • All day long nausea • Extreme constipation • Abdominal cramping/pain from the gas trapped and constipation • Difficulty fluctuating • NO appetite whatsoever, every food sounds disgusting and hard to eat • Anxiety and fear mixed with deep sadness • Fatigued and weak • Feeling like I'm slowly dying but trying to make it through each day, day by day • Debilitating - I hardly want to go out and do anything, need to sit out a lot."
21,"Infection under a tooth root canal with pain and some swelling. Amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day. Started to work within a few hours, felt so fantastic the next day. This stuff is better than any pain medication on earth if you need it! No side effects yet on day two. I recommend not more than two beers or drinks as I had a slight feeling in my stomach after three beers, I drank some water and was fine. Who rates antibiotics anyway? I mean, really. I love amoxicillin!"
22,"Bad tooth infection, and the dentist gave Amoxicillin 3 x 500 mg a day. Day 3, no side effects, and pain gone/swelling reducing. I have had progressively bad back pain for 23 years due to epidural. Led to me not being able to walk more than 9 paces without serious pain, where if I don't sit down, my legs will go from under me. I went shopping with my husband today, and for the first time in 3 years, I walked around, not one, but two supermarkets instead of sitting in the car as I have done for 3 years. MRI scan indicated the only thing left is an operation which could make the situation better or worse. What is in this Amoxicillin that has given me my body back? I have never felt so well-20 years younger, in fact. I hope when I finish the course, I don't get the pain back and can continue to walk. I think this needs investigating."
23,"I am pregnant, two of my bottom molars crumbled away due to pregnancy. I’ve been in agony for two months, both molars open, nerves exposed. NHS refusing to treat me because of COVID-19. I can’t eat properly, have indigestion because of poorly chewed food and severe pain day after day. I am absolutely exhausted as I can’t sleep, the pain triples at night and all I am left with as pregnant is paracetamol. Now they both got infected, the gums have been red for a long time, the constant pain indescribable. All they gave me was amoxicillin, which after four days has made it only ten times worse. I am in tears all day long, and at night I am almost fainting from the pain, struggling to breathe. I can’t even lie down or turn my head, I just want to scream. I have never been this desperate and sore. The dentist I got to speak to over the phone wasn’t even sure if the antibiotics were going to work, but gave me a choice of nothing or that. Then suggested I do my own filling at home with a home filling kit."
24,"I'm a 54-year-old, 235 lb, healthy white male. I was prescribed amoxicillin by my dentist. Reason: I had a toothache for five days, finally went to see my dentist. The gum around one molar was infected, painful to the touch, and with pus coming out when the dentist poked it with her dental instrument. She prescribed a dose of 500 mg tablets to take three times per day for seven days. After just one day of taking the drug, my pain was almost completely gone. Three days into the treatment, both the pain and the infection were completely gone. I'm on the last day of my seven-day treatment and no side effects at all, except I'm feeling a bit more tired than usual, but I sleep like a baby at night. I'm very happy with this drug."
25,"Had an infection on a back molar and was prescribed amoxicillin because of the pandemic. I was on other pain relievers alongside this, and the infection was gone within 4 days and no pain at all. But I’m here now a few weeks later (maybe a month), and the toothache is back. Will call the dentist to see if I have to take another course of it, but it worked for the time I took it."
