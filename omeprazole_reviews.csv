1,"On omeprazole for 11 days, which 5 years ago & I had all side effects mentioned - anxiety, stomach pain, severe brain fog, etc. I had 3 trips to ER with heart pounding & racing, numerous tests to try to diagnose. It took 6 months to feel 100%. Upped nutrition & made my own rehydration liquid (coconut water, fresh oranges & lemons, etc). I used organic products when possible, wanted as few toxins in my body, exercised, increased vitamins & supplements (B12 & magnesium), and started yoga. Symptoms slowly decreased over the next 6 months - symptoms didn’t cease immediately after stopping. PLEASE don’t lose hope if you are still experiencing symptoms! Stay on a regimen of optimum nutrition & hydration & symptoms will slowly subside over several months. I feel like the poison got into every crevice of my body & invaded tissue & muscles, so took time to flush out. Do NOT let doctors tell you that it’s all in your head, that medication can’t cause these side effects! Wishing everyone hope for recovery & encouragement for a return to normal. It WILL get better:)"
2,"I was left on this medication, omeprazole, for around 6 years by my doctor for stomach acid. I am from the UK, so although we have a national health service, it’s a common occurrence not to receive a sufficient level of care. Anyway, I managed to replace the benefits that these tablets did assist with by instead taking vitamins. I stopped taking it 5 months ago, and I cannot put into words how amazing I have felt ever since. Anxiety and depression have lifted enormously! I used to get anxious about the smallest things, such as driving my car or having a certain type of juice in the house. Just the daftest things ever. I’m sleeping better than I ever was. No brain fog, memory, and concentration have increased significantly. I cannot recall a time when my mood has been constantly high throughout my life (32). I truly believe these tablets severely impacted my mental health for all those years, so I strongly advise anyone either taking or thinking about taking them to not bother. Look into natural aids instead!"
3,"My wife has been off this stuff for about 3 weeks now and is still plagued with the anxiety, insomnia, pins and needles etc. Can anyone tell me how long it took for them to be free of this misery? Thanks so much...we hope every day that these horrible side effects subside...please give me some good news!! Thanks so much!"
4,"DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE!!!!! This medicine has ripped the life out from inside me. I went from being my totally normal happy self to having serious panic attacks, constant anxiety/depression, and a general feeling of hopelessness. The symptoms started on my 12th day, and I stopped taking the pill on my 13th day. It is a week later, and the panic attacks, anxiety, depression, and hopelessness still remain. This drug is poison to me and many others!!!"
5,"My acid reflux came back recently, so I went to see a doctor. She prescribed me to take 20mg omeprazole every morning. Three days had passed, and I noticed dizziness, inability to focus, my eyes couldn’t focus on one thing...they always dilated, diarrhea, fatigue, paranoia, anxiety spiked! I took it for exactly six days. My dad told me not to take it anymore, and we’ll soon be headed to the doctor. It works for some, but the reviews that I have been reading are exactly how I feel...if you experience any one of these symptoms, stop taking them immediately! I read that someone had seizures! I wish you all well and will be taking the natural way suggested...baking soda + water, apple cider vinegar, and ginger tea!"
6,"I started experiencing tightness in the middle of my chest with constant belching and a pinching stomach pain in my upper right abdomen. Dr. diagnosed me with acid reflux and put me on Prilosec OTC 20mg for 14 days. I just started taking the pills and man... my anxiety was 10x worse. I was anxious, heart racing, nauseated, stomach pain, brain fog, blurred vision and overall I felt like crying and just so awful. Please talk to your doctor for other alternative medicine. I don’t recommend taking these."
7,"Started a short treatment of Prilosec for an acid reflux flare up. 40mg a day. Took for 16 days before we realized what was happening! I’m generally in great health, fit, healthy weight, on no medications, and have never experienced depression. This medication caused me to have anxiety, heart palpitations, loss of appetite, weight loss, extreme depression, tingling in the hands and feet, and worsened my acid reflux symptoms! Once we realized these symptoms were actually side effects of the medication, I stopped taking it! That was 2 weeks ago. The depression has very slowly lifted, the anxiety keeps coming and going, the acid reflux is cleared up, and appetite is improving every day. No degree of acid reflux is worth going through what I’ve been going through the past month! DON'T TAKE IT!"
8,"This medication will drag you to a place where you really don't want to be. What I'm feeling is chest heaviness, dizziness, severe anxiety, panic episodes, shakiness, sweating, diarrhea shortness of breath. It is nothing to worry about, my symptoms got better after a few weeks. However, the doctor made me start it again and I now know that everything that just randomly started going wrong with me is all linked to this medication. And when I say anxiety, I mean severe amplified anxiety. Like the kind where you can't sleep at night because you panic thinking tonight is the night. Do not take this medication. Ever. You don't know anxiety until you take this. I'm not sure why this is even a med to begin with. Keep your head up and read my review. I promise you'll be okay after a few weeks. You're not dying. Just going through a bad side effect that will subside."
9,"Hey guys! One night I had too much wine and woke up with stabbing pain between my breasts in the middle. I went to the doctor, got diagnosed with GERD. They prescribed me 40mg of omeprazole. I started taking it, and it helped; a few days later, the stabbing pain was gone. Then I started feeling rib pain and lower sternum pain. The doctor told me it was because of GERD. However, the more I took it, the worse it got. Three weeks after taking this medication, I was in horrendous rib pain all over my upper body, experiencing chest wall pain and could not move. I had to go to the ER, where X-rays and blood tests revealed nothing. I also lost a bunch of weight, had blurry vision, terrible brain fog, warm arms, swollen toes, insomnia, and horrendous body pain. I felt like I could not move. My stool looked like it came out the same way it went in, full of food junks, etc. I stopped taking it, and now a month off of it, the rib pain and all the other side effects are going away. I still have a tiny bit of pain left but feel better. Seriously, what is this medication? Avoid it if you can."
10,"I've been taking this pill for 3 weeks. Started to feel dizziness, headache, and lightheaded. Loss of appetite, chills, tingling, brain fog, and feels like being drunk all the time. Has been hit hard. Off the meds for 3 weeks. And still feel woozy and drunk. The meds haven't worn off yet. Anyone know what to do at the moment?"
11,"Evil drug!!! Do not take it. It took me over 4 months to get over the side effects, and I still have little lapses to this day, a year later. Not sure what they have done, but it's like they put my whole nervous system on overdrive. Horrible drug. Honestly, I'd rather let the gastric acid do the maximum damage than ever go through that again. Experiencing dizziness, brain fog, eye twitches, muscle spasms randomly all over, more noticeable on the left shoulder and arm. It made me nervous about everything. I was horrible to people, getting very aggressive over nothing, burning and itching of the skin, pins and needles in feet and hands, non-stop congestion, earache, waking up during sleep feeling like I'd stopped breathing. This is probably around half of what I went through, the list is endless."
12,"DO NOT TAKE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!! I have lost 7 months of my life to this drug. I was at a loose end and wanted everything to be over!! I went from a man enjoying his life to a severely depressed and unhappy person. The omeprazole prescribed for my heartburn, unknowingly to me, gave me crippling anxiety, depression, dizziness, brain fog, feeling like I was going to blackout constantly, helplessness, crying.. you name it!! I stopped the Omeprazole 4 days ago and wow, I feel like a new man back to my old self! No depression, no anxiety... WOW!! Please avoid this awful drug at all costs!!!"
13,"My daughter was put on these for 14 days. I’ve never seen someone change so dramatically. By her last day of taking them, she was pacing her room saying she felt like she was going to die and that something bad was going to happen. She has never suffered with anxiety before or panic attacks. Brain fog, shooting pains in her head, can't stop crying. It’s been 4 weeks since she stopped these, and she is really struggling. She is taking extra vitamins and eating but is desperate to know how long this is going to last. She has gone from being an outgoing girl to not leaving the house. Any advice appreciated. Her doctor has prescribed antidepressants, but she’s reluctant to take these as she has never needed them before."
14,"After 12 days of taking this medicine, I feel crazy! Sudden head rushes when I stand up. A feeling of my ears being full. Heart palpitations, chest tightness, etc. It did help with my acid reflux, but I had to stop taking it. I can't deal with the side effects. Going to lose weight and cut off certain foods."
15,"OMG, I have just read these omeprazole reviews. I just thank each and every one of you for sharing your experiences as you have solved my health issues that I have been suffering for a year and a half, probably longer. I even went to see my cardiologist and went through an angiogram as I felt so bad. Pains in my chest going through to my back and down my arms. My cardiologist said my arteries were all clear and these feelings must have been due to your sotalol beta blockers giving you side effects. I have just spent 4 nights in the hospital trying to get to the bottom of these horrendous feelings. By reading your reviews on Omeprazole, I'm sure that's what's wrong with me. As you say, it is one awful drug as it's ruined my life for the past 2 years, I would say. THANK YOU FOR SHARING"
16,"Took 40 mg once a day before breakfast. Noticed some anxiety on Day 5. By Day 11, I was completely exhausted. I had brain fog, weight loss, nausea, blurry vision, and extreme anxiety. It has been 3 weeks since I quit this medicine. Brain fog has subsided, however, anxiety keeps coming and going. Hang in there, stay tough. This medicine will take its course and time to wash out completely from your system. I am hoping to fully recover in the near future. Exercise and stay positive."
17,"I have taken Prilosec for over 15 years. It works great for the heartburn/reflux/GERD. But let me tell you what it took away from me! It dropped my iron and my iron stores to the bottom, it also took my B12 to the bottom. It also, after years of taking it, gave me anxiety, cramping of muscles, and led to my potassium being low as well. Then, most recently, I kept having a horrible burning in my stomach, well, guess what Prilosec gave me most of all! A stomach full of gastric polyps!! So now I have weaned myself off this horrible medicine because gastric polyps are a side effect of it and no one tells you! And if you keep taking it, well, guess what, it makes even more in your stomach once it starts!! So I weaned myself off it, took over a month."
18,"This omeprazole stuff is horrible. Sure, it got rid of the heartburn issues I was having, but the side effects are horrific and scary. Even more scary is they don't include the litany of scary side effects. While on this wretched drug, I had pain in my thighs, slightly swollen lower legs, increased blood pressure, tingling in my hands and feet, lethargic legs, water retention, and a painful right testicle. Of course, none of these side effects, which can be found online on sites, but aren't mentioned on the packaging. So, while taking this dangerous drug, I was having these issues and not realizing it was the drug because these side effects weren't mentioned. I thought I was having some other type of horrible medical condition(s). Luckily, I realized all these conditions cropped up after I started the drug. Once stopped, my conditions all began to improve and go away. Beware of this cursed drug. It can screw you up big time. Never again."
19,"Does anyone know how long these horrible side effects last? I've taken them for two weeks and now been off them for two weeks so far. Brain fog has lessened but I'm still experiencing anxiety, depression, emotionless, and a soulless feeling from time to time. I could sleep the first week off of them, now in the second week, I'm having a hard time sleeping, snapping awake, muscle jerking, and a needles-in-my-skin feeling. This pill is awful. I've heard it could take a month or two to normalize."
20,"I have had heartburn for years. I was put on this omeprazole medication and it worked well for my heartburn. However, after about 2 months or so, I began to feel symptoms that I couldn't pin to one thing or another. Back aches, light-headedness, fatigue, anxiety, shoulder pain, and my rib cage felt like I got beat up. Also, it felt like a basketball was in my stomach. So, I started chasing down side effects with the meds I take and started to see ALL these side effects tied to this drug. I am now on day 2 of not taking them. I just hope it is not too long before the side effects start to subside."
21,"I complained about having sharp pains occasionally just below the breasts and the Dr. told me it was acid build-up, and that I should take an omeprazole every morning. On day 5, I got very lightheaded and dizzy every time I stood up, felt my heart racing, and felt anxious. I stopped taking the pills that day, and three days later I'm still feeling lightheaded, a general feeling of heaviness in my chest, and, most concerning, a tidal wave of depression. I am wondering how long it will take this to get out of my system because I feel so wonky."
22,"Absolutely awful, dangerous, one of the worst experiences of my life. It is finally time to share my story in hopes it helps others not go through this. I waited until the nightmare was 100% over and that garbage was out of my system. I was prescribed 80mg per day of Omeprazole on June 11, 2021, and took that amount daily for 7 weeks. In late July, I had severe mental fog, insane anxiety, near-impossible ability to drive, often felt like I would pass out driving. This nightmare continued for exactly 2 months after going cold turkey off that garbage. 2 months of being terrified to drive, feeling awful, hugging the berm, going under the speed limit, fearing for my life. If your doctor tells you there are no side effects with this drug like mine did, they are full of you-know-what. Please think of alternate solutions. This can wreck your life and others, literally. Big Pharma won't want you to know that. I highly recommend you do not go through this and find healthy solutions."
23,"I suffer from extreme chest pain related to GERD-induced esophageal spasms. Omeprazole is the only medicine that I've been given that can even come close to alleviating my reflux and therefore my pain. The problem though is that this medication makes me so sick I can hardly function. It causes nausea, dizziness, brain fog, muscle fatigue, and eventually leads to a kind of painful swelling lump feeling at the base of my throat that can be highly distracting. It's horrible but so is the chest pain from reflux. So, when the pain gets unbearable, I take the Omeprazole and stop when it makes me sick (usually around day 8 or 9), then I quit the medication until the chest pain again becomes unbearable. It's a vicious, awful, horrible cycle between pain and illness. If you can avoid this medication, do!"
24,"I took this for 5 days for acid reflux. I experienced extreme anxiety and panic attacks. I couldn’t sleep at all as every time I was dropping off, I had a huge adrenaline rush. I couldn’t function and had 4 weeks off work sick. I realized on the 5th day that these tablets must be the cause, so I researched it only to find other people had similar symptoms. I stopped taking them straight away. The doctor had to prescribe anxiety tablets Duloxetine as I was in such a state of anxiety. The doctor would not believe that the tablets have these side effects. I tackled the acid reflux with an alkaline-only diet, and a year later I am now back to normal and off the anxiety tablets. I would advise anyone to not take these tablets, they caused me to literally have a breakdown. Thank God I stopped taking them when I did."
25,"I've given by my MD this worst medicine! 2 weeks consumed it. On the 10th or 11th days, I feel brain fog, my upper and lower back feel so painful. Anxiety got higher. It has been a month already since I stopped it, the side effects are still in my body. Seriously, whatever PPI kind of medicine... Do not ever take it."
